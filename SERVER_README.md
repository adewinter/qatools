To run the server run:


```
npm install
node server.js
```

Whenever you make a change to `server.js` you need to restart `node` (just press Ctrl+C and re-run `node server.js`).


To run commands that would normally be run in the terminal, we use https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs

You can see an example of this in the server.js file.
